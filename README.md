# ObjectManagement
A project that deals with creating, keeping track of, saving, and loading objects.

I followed Catlike Coding's tutorial on object management and these were my learnings.

->Always code with backward compatibility for save files so that old save files are also supported.
->Component based approach like each behavior is a different component but they all are inherited from a common shape behavior class.
->How to manage communication between different scenes and how to keep code and hierarchy organised.
->Efficiently using the game loop for physics.
->I also got an understanding of how to create custom inspectors and editors.
->Learned about sealed and partial classes as well as explicit and impilicit operator method(Learnt there use cases in code).

# To Do:

->Create a demo with a menu to choose different scenes and player can experiment with different factor.
->Importing their custom meshes.
